# Facebook Group Scraper
 
The file present in this project is a script to scrape Facebook group members and export them into a CSV file. Copy-paste the script into your Chrome console. 

## How to run the script?

To proceed, follow these steps:

- Go to a Facebook group page. You need to be on the right page, specifically the one that contains the list of all the members of the Facebook group you want to scrape (https://www.facebook.com/groups/your_group/members).

- Open Chrome Developer Console.

- Copy and paste the following code into the console. It will add a "Download 0 members" button.

- No need to scroll, let the script work for you. The auto-scroll will stop once you'll get to the bottom of the page.

- Once done, click on the "Download X members" button to download the generated CSV file.
